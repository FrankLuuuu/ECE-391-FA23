1: When I first wrote draw_vert_line and tested it, scrolling to the right instantly led to a black screen. I copied and pasted the code from draw horizontal line and when 
    changing between x and y, I missed a few variables. For example, I was still using the varibale horiz_line_fn instead of changing it to vert_line_fn. Finding the bug: 
    15 minutes. Fixing the bug: 10 minutes.

2: When I finished coding the rest of part 1, my code was not running due to a "‘for’ loop initial declarations are only allowed in C99 mode" error. I had to search up how 
    to fix it and moved all counter declarations in for loops outside. Finding the bug: 10 minutes. Fixing the bug: 5 minutes.

3: I had a black status bar at the bottom of the screen without the room name, underscore cursor, nor the status message. No matter what operations I did, the texts would 
    not show up. Eventually, I was experimenting with the color palette and change the value, the status bar changed colors and the texts start showing up. My color value 
    for the background of the status bar was "0x9A" and it was changed to "0x1B", which fixed the issue. I assume some value turn the status bar black, which then blends 
    in with the texts. Finding the bug: 5 hours. Fixing the bug: 5 minutes. This one took a while to find because it could have been due to errors from a lot of different 
    places in the program.

4: The room name is not displaying to the status bar at all. I had an underscore always displayed to the center of the screen. The status message is showing up fine when it
    should be, but with an underscore at the end. I cannot type onto the status bar. I initially thought the problem was in the offset values of image_gen, but it was actually 
    because I needed to add a condition when printing the underscore since I only print it if user types a command. Finding the bug: 1 hour. Fixing the bug: 10 minutes.

5: The underscore, along with the room name, is now not displaying at all, and the status message is showing up perfectly. I also cannot type onto the status bar. I initially
    thought what I did previously to fix #4 made the bug worse. But, it was due to the condition used to call image_gen for printing room name and typed command being 
    incorrect. I checked if the status message is NULL and I changed it to check if the status message is empty. Finding the bug: 2 hours. Fixing the bug: 15 minutes.
