### P1 Solution

a. The Line Compare field defines the scan line where a horizontal division can be established, facilitating split-screen functionality. If no horizontal division is necessary, this field should be set to 3FFh. The 6th bit of the Maximum Scan Line Register stores the 9th bit of the Line Compare field. The 4th bit of the Overflow Register stores the 8th bit of the Line Compare field. The Line Compare Register stores the 7-0 bits of the Line Compare field. When the line counter reaches the value in the Line Compare Register, the current scan line's starting address is reset to 0. The first constrait to note is that the starting display memory address for the bottom window is set to a fixed value of 0. So, unless you intentionally employ a split-screen mode to duplicate memory, you must arrange the memory allocation in such a way that the bottom screen occupies the lower addresses, and the top screen follows it. Also, either both windows are shifted by an equal amount when panning, or only the top window shifts, while the panning values for the bottom window remain fixed at 0. Another constraint is the "Preset Row Scan" field only applies to the top window and for the bottom window, the effective "Preset Row Scan" value is set to 0.

b. Set the DAC Write Address Register to the palette entry's index value. Write the 6-bits value of the red, green, and blue intensities to the DAC Data Register.
